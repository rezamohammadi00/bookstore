// tips:
// beforeInteractive: Use this strategy for scripts that must load before the page becomes interactive, like essential analytics or monitoring tools.
// afterInteractive: When you use this strategy, the script loads after the page becomes interactive, which is the default behavior. This is ideal for scripts that add functionality but arenâ€™t essential for initial rendering.
// lazyOnload: Defers loading the script until all other page resources have finished loading. This is perfect for non-essential scripts like ads or social media widgets.
